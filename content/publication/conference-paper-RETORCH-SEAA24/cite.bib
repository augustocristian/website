   abstract = {Dispatcher entity. The Resource Dispatcher centralizes the Resource management and allocates the test Resources to the different test suites executed in the continuous integration system, according to their compatible usage. Our approach seeks efficient Resource sharing among test cases, test suites, and suite executions, reducing the need for Resource redeployments and improving the execution time. We have conducted a proof of concept, based on real-world continuous integration data, that shows savings in both Resource redeployments and execution time},
