abstract = {Testing web applications is a challenging practice because it involves managing asynchronous requests between clients and servers, the integration of heterogeneous technologies, and concurrent accesses to the resources. Therefore, rerunning the test cases of these applications under the same conditions is difficult as one test case can be executed in many different ways according to several environmental factors like memory, screen size or network. Moreover, some of these test cases could be flaky, i.e., due to environmental factors the test outcome can vary even though the application did not change. Understanding which factors are the root cause of flakiness is very important for web developers to both prevent and fix flakiness. This paper introduces a technique to locate the root causes of flakiness based on a characterization of the different environmental factors that are not controlled during the testing of web applications. The root cause of flakiness is located by a spectrum-based localization technique that analyses the execution of the same flaky test under different environmental factors that can trigger the flakiness. The technique is illustrated on an educational web platform named FullTeaching.},
